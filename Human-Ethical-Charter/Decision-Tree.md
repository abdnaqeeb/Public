# Illustrative Decision Tree for Applying the Charter

This decision tree provides a **practical tool** for interpreting the *Human Ethical Charter*.  
It translates the ten articles into a series of questions that help evaluate whether a behavior or attribute is to be considered a **Virtue, Vice, Exception, or Subject to Review**.  

It is not a replacement for the Charterâ€™s principles, but an illustrative guide to support decision-making in real contexts.
