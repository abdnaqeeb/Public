# üåç The Human Ethical Charter

## Preamble
Since the dawn of history, humankind has sought rules to govern life in community. Ethics have always been the backbone of societies: they build trust, allow humans to live within families, among friends, and with neighbors. Without ethics, humans lose the sense of belonging and become isolated individuals living in fear and mistrust.

Yet, despite this central role, moral systems differ across societies:
- Some are founded on **religious commands**.
- Others are rooted in **ethnic or cultural traditions**.
- Still others emerge from **political ideologies** or **professional codes**.

This diversity often makes moral judgment relative: what is virtue in one community may be vice in another. Throughout history, such divergence has fueled disputes and even wars, as each group claimed its moral framework as the only true one.

The **Human Ethical Charter** does not seek to abolish this diversity, nor to replace religions, cultures, or political systems. On the contrary, it acknowledges the right of every community to preserve its moral identity. What this Charter proposes is a **minimal common ground**‚Äîa set of principles on which all humans can stand when meeting as members of one humanity.

The Charter may be seen as a **second language of ethics**:
- Every community keeps its "mother tongue" of morals‚Äîits religion, culture, or tradition.
- But when peoples and nations meet, they require a **shared language** to reduce conflict and enable coexistence.

This Charter offers such a shared language: simple, universal, non-sectarian, and based on fundamental values that all can recognize‚Äîhuman dignity, justice, compassion, and sustainability.

## Chapter: The Diversity and Contradictions of Morality
Morality has always guided human life, but it is rarely uniform. Across time and cultures, values have shifted, contradicted one another, and often served as both bridges and barriers.

Imagine that **compassion** is praised as a supreme virtue. When a member of one‚Äôs community dies, people say ‚Äúmay God have mercy on him.‚Äù Yet when someone from another community dies, the same words are forbidden. Compassion, once universal, becomes restricted.

Or consider **truthfulness**. Parents tell their children: ‚Äúalways tell the truth, even against yourself.‚Äù But in times of war, lying to the enemy is celebrated as cleverness‚Äî‚Äúall warfare is based on deception.‚Äù

Even in daily life, truth itself becomes double-edged. A friend asks your opinion on his new clothes. If you speak the harsh truth, you hurt him. If you tell a ‚Äúwhite lie,‚Äù you preserve his dignity. Suddenly, lying seems more ethical than honesty.

**Generosity** also shifts: in one situation it is noble, in another it is wasteful excess. **Frugality** is despised as miserliness, unless it is reframed as prudent management.

In peacetime, **killing** is condemned as the gravest crime. In war, the same act is honored as heroism or martyrdom. **Justice** too is relative: favoritism toward one‚Äôs child is natural in the home but condemned as corruption in public life.

Values also change over time: vengeance was once a matter of honor, today it is a crime. Acts once shamed as immoral‚Äîsuch as personal freedoms or orientations‚Äîare now accepted or even protected by law.

Politics adds further contradictions: speaking the truth is virtue, unless it challenges the ruler‚Äîthen it becomes treason. Obedience is virtue, unless it enables oppression‚Äîthen it becomes vice. Even **intentions** alter judgment: lying is condemned, but lying to save a life becomes heroism. Violence is condemned, but violence to defend a child becomes courage.

These examples reveal a troubling pattern: morality, as practiced, is filled with exceptions and contradictions. Without a shared compass, humans risk losing their ethical bearings.

### The Role of the Human Ethical Charter
The Charter does not deny the natural flexibility of ethics, nor does it aim to freeze morality into rigid rules. Rather, it seeks to provide a **minimal common ground**‚Äîa set of principles that remain valid across cultures, times, and circumstances.

- **Human dignity as inviolable**: compassion cannot be restricted to one group.  
- **Justice as the foundation of all relations**: deceit cannot be excused by enmity.  
- **Truth with compassion**: honesty must protect dignity, not wound it.  
- **Sustainability and trust**: generosity should not become waste, nor prudence miserliness.  
- **Rights limited only in existential catastrophes**: even war does not justify erasing humanity.  
- **Review and participation**: moral details may evolve, but higher principles remain constant.  

Thus, the Human Ethical Charter becomes a **global moral bridge**: it does not erase differences, but safeguards fundamental values against collapse, giving humanity a shared language to transcend contradictions and prevent conflict.

## The Charter: Principles and Explanatory Articles

### Article 1: Human Dignity is a Red Line
**Text:** Every human being has the right to life, liberty, and respect. No one may be humiliated, degraded, or stripped of their humanity.  
**Explanation:** Human dignity is absolute. It transcends religious, ethnic, and cultural divides, forming the first foundation against discrimination and dehumanization.

---

### Article 2: No One Left Behind
**Text:** Society must ensure every individual has access to food, shelter, health, and education.  
**Explanation:** This principle guarantees social justice and prevents extreme inequality where some live in plenty while others starve or suffer without shelter or knowledge.

---

### Article 3: Reduce Pain, Increase Happiness
**Text:** Communities must strive to minimize suffering and maximize well-being, giving priority to the weakest and most marginalized.  
**Explanation:** This integrates utilitarian concern for well-being with justice, ensuring that improving the lives of the vulnerable is a central moral duty.

---

### Article 4: Justice is the Foundation of Every Relation
**Text:** Happiness or collective interest may not be pursued through injustice or discrimination.  
**Explanation:** Burdens and benefits must be distributed fairly among individuals, groups, and generations. War or conflict cannot excuse violations of justice.

---

### Article 5: Care is Everyone‚Äôs Responsibility
**Text:** Every individual has special duties arising from human relations: parents toward children, physicians toward patients, leaders toward their people.  
**Explanation:** This distinguishes between universal equal rights and specific duties of care, affirming that ethical responsibility is heightened in contexts of dependency and trust.

---

### Article 6: Virtues Build Our Lives
**Text:** Societies should cultivate virtues such as courage, honesty, compassion, justice, and self-control.  
**Explanation:** Ethics must not rely on rules alone but on character. Virtues sustain human flourishing and provide resilience against moral relativism.

---

### Article 7: No ‚ÄúVices‚Äù by Custom Alone
**Text:** No behavior may be condemned as vice solely because tradition or religion labels it so.  
**Explanation:** Moral judgment must be tested against objective standards: does it violate dignity, harm justice, or reduce well-being? If not, it cannot be deemed a vice. This prevents customs from being misused to justify oppression.

---

### Article 8: Decisions for Honesty and Sustainability
**Text:** Actions and policies must build trust and serve future generations.  
**Explanation:** Ethics must consider long-term consequences. Short-term gains that destroy the environment, deplete resources, or betray trust are not moral.

---

### Article 9: Rights Limited Only in Great Crises
**Text:** Fundamental rights may be restricted only in existential catastrophes, and even then only temporarily, minimally, and under clear oversight.  
**Explanation:** This principle prevents governments or groups from abusing emergencies as a pretext for oppression. Rights remain protected except under extreme, narrowly defined conditions.

---

### Article 10: Review and Participation for All
**Text:** The Charter shall be reviewed periodically with participation from all communities and individuals.  
**Explanation:** Ethics are a living system, evolving with knowledge and history. Yet higher principles‚Äîdignity, justice, compassion, sustainability‚Äîremain untouchable. Universal participation ensures legitimacy and adaptability.

## Closing Statement
We, the undersigned, present this **Human Ethical Charter** not as a substitute for religions, cultures, or political traditions, but as a shared foundation upon which humanity can stand together.

In a world of diverse beliefs and shifting values, this Charter offers a minimal common ground: a universal ethical language based on dignity, justice, compassion, and sustainability.

We call upon:
- **Nations**, to recognize these principles as guiding lights for law and policy.  
- **Communities and cultures**, to embrace them as bridges that connect rather than walls that divide.  
- **Institutions‚Äîschools, hospitals, organizations**, to display and practice them as daily reminders of our shared humanity.  
- **Individuals everywhere**, to live by them in their families, workplaces, and societies.  

By affirming these principles, humanity declares: **we are one community, bound by dignity, justice, care, and responsibility for future generations**.
